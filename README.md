# ICE Compiler
ICE Compiler is a program that compiles TI-BASIC-like language to ASM, the machine code. Create insane games, use the color screen, and make the step to ASM smaller! Speed up your BASIC programs and it's super easy to use! Type your program in the normal editor, compile it within seconds, and you have hours of fun! It doesn't require any shell.

## Building
If you would like to build ICE, be sure you have the latest [CE C Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases/latest) installed.

Then simply clone or download the repository, and build with `make`.
